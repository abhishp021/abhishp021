## Work Experience

### CrimeCheck 
#### ML Engineer (July 2022-present)

##### Legal Bot
The Legal Bot project began as an exploration into developing a sophisticated chatbot capable of addressing legal queries effectively. Here's an overview of the project's journey:
- Initial Training: We started by training a GPT model from scratch to understand its behavior and performance, focusing initially on Next Word Prediction (NWP). While it showed promise, its limitations for chatbot applications became evident.
- Data Training and Challenges: Transitioning to a specific Q&A dataset improved the model's performance, but challenges persisted, particularly with out-of-bounds (OOB) data. We experimented with various models and approaches to address these issues.
- Falcon Model Integration: Discovering the Falcon model, well-trained on both NWP and chatbot tasks, sparked hope. However, training a larger model presented computational challenges, leading us to adopt the LORA fine-tuning approach.
- Chunking and Model Refinement: Despite initial successes, challenges with large documents and context extraction persisted. We devised a chunking strategy and employed RoBERTa for relevance scoring to enhance accuracy.
- Fine-Tuning and Model Selection: Exploring supervised fine-tuning methods and leveraging publicly available datasets proved fruitful. We experimented with multiple models and ultimately found that those fine-tuned for coding tasks performed best for our purposes.

##### Court Record/FIR Case Search
- Developed and deployed a sophisticated search system for court records and FIR cases, leveraging machine learning-based models for efficient comparison of unstructured Indian names and addresses.
- Integrated custom-built models into the search system, facilitating accurate identification of individuals with relevant case histories.
- Utilized Elastic Search as the underlying platform, managing a vast database of over 25 crore court records for seamless retrieval and analysis.
- Significantly reduced the False Positive Rate from 50% to less than 2%, enhancing the system's accuracy and reliability in identifying relevant case histories.
- Implemented custom phonetic and spellcheck features in the Name model, improving accuracy and robustness in name comparison tasks.
- Enhanced precision of the Address model from 72% to 91% by implementing a weighted tri-gram approach for vectorization and leveraging the LightGBM model for superior performance.

##### Act and Section Standardization
- Developed and deployed an API for standardizing acts and sections extracted from court records, converting over 9 lakh unstructured acts into 2,213 standardized acts.
- Successfully standardized a large volume of unstructured acts and sections extracted from court records, enhancing the accessibility and usability of legal information.
- Leveraged data augmentation techniques to enrich the training data for standard acts with limited mentions, improving model performance and accuracy in act standardization.
- Attained a remarkable accuracy rate of 96.2% in accurately mapping unstructured acts to standardized ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of the standardization API in processing diverse legal documents.

##### Data Analysis Tasks
- Successfully conducted 17 data analysis projects, demonstrating proficiency in handling diverse datasets and analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights.
- Produced a wide range of deliverables including detailed reports, visually appealing geographical plots, informative blogs, and engaging infographics to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.
- Utilized SQL and Elasticsearch queries to access and manipulate data, streamlining the data analysis process and enabling efficient exploration of large datasets.

##### Churn Prediction
- Engineered a robust system to detect revenue anomalies among the top 30 clients, utilizing advanced time series models and feature engineering techniques.
- Developed alert notifications to proactively identify clients at risk of discontinuing services, enabling timely intervention and retention efforts.
- Extended the alert notification system to monitor the performance of CrimeCheck employees, ensuring consistent service quality and adherence to service level agreements (SLAs).

### UPSC Civil Services Preparation
#### 2017-2022

- Qualified for CSE Mains twice (99th percentile).
- Achieved a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and their practical applications.
- Developed strong analytical and critical thinking skills through an extensive study of diverse subjects.
