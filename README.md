## Work Experience

### CrimeCheck 
#### ML Engineer (July 2022-present)

- Developed and deployed an **API** for Act and Section Standardization, converting more than **9 lakh** acts in court records into **2,213** standard acts. Utilized Data Augmentation since more than 1,400 standard acts had less than 3 mentions in the training data. Achieved an impressive accuracy of **96.2%** (**99.2%** for single act prediction).
- Engineered a robust system to detect **revenue anomalies** among the top 30 clients by employing advanced **time series models** and **feature engineering**. Created **alert notifications** for clients that might discontinue our services. Also, designed similar alert notifications for work done by CrimeCheck employees.
- Completed **17 data analysis** and **visualization** projects on extensive datasets, delivering valuable insights in the form of extensive **reports**, geographical **plots**, **blogs**, and **infographics** for data-driven decision making.

### UPSC Civil Services Preparation
#### 2017-2022

- Qualified for CSE Mains twice (99th percentile).
- Achieved a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and their practical applications.
- Developed strong analytical and critical thinking skills through an extensive study of diverse subjects.
